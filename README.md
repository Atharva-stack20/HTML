This is my HTML code repo in which I have covered multiple tags and built multiple small-scale projects by just using HTML <br>

I have divided the HTML into 5 levels, which go from basics to advanced. <br>
Levels are as follows: <br>
	"\t" 1. Level 1 - In this level, I have covered what is a comment, how to use it, and just a basic code of HTML.
